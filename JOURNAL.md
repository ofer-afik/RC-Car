## 10/13/2025 - Bought parts - LOOONG time ago  

### Well, it was a long time ago.
I bought most of the parts needed. I spent about 2h finding the parts, and I bought them, since it was before I heard of hack club. Now I'm actually going to use those parts...

#### Missing:
Pretty much all that's missing is the pcb designing and buying, which I want funding for.

#### What I have:

I have a _bit_ more, but these are the main things.  

## 10/17/2025 - Was Stupid  

### Well, I was.
Originally, when I bought the stuff, I planned to do this on a breadboard. Now, when I revived this project, I thought to work on a pcb. Now, after trying to find an esp32 dev board footprint,and trying to create one when I didn't find it, I decided it wasn't worth it.
